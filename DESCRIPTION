Description: CBioProfiler (Cancer Biomarker and subtype Profiler) was developed to facilitate researchers and clinicians to screen, characterize, annotate and translate cancer biomarkers and subtypes from molecular level to clinical settings more comfortably with graphical user interfaces (GUI), which will help implement targeted clinical diagnosis and treatment measures for different patients to achieve precision medicine. CBioProfiler integrated a novel R package CuratedCancerPrognosisData that reviewed, curated and integrated the gene expression data and corresponding clinical data of 47,210 clinical samples from 268 gene expression studies of 43 common blood and solid tumors. The whole pipeline of CBioProfiler includes two main pipelines: cancer biomarker pipeline and cancer subtype pipeline. The cancer biomarker pipeline includes 5 modules: (1) dimensionality reduction using three methods of weighted gene co-expression network analysis(WGCNA), univariate Cox proportional hazards regression model(CoxPH), differentially expressed gene (DEG) analysis, (2) benchmark experiment with 6 machine learning learners (Lasso, Ridge, Elastic net, Glmboost, Coxboost, Randomforest) using cross validation (CV) and nested cross validation (nCV) based on R package mlr, (3) prediction model construction using Cox proportional hazards regression model and nomogram, (4) clinical annotation using a variety of clinical approaches (correlation with clinical features, Kaplan-Meier curve, CoxPH model, time-dependent ROC, most correlated genes, correlation with specific gene, gene expression in different groups, correlation with immune infiltration, correlation with stemness score, correlation with ESTIMATE score, correlation with immune checkpoint, correlation with IFN-gamma score, correlation with cytolytic activity, correlation with cancer pathway, correlation with metabolism pathway, correlation with hallmark signature, correlation with drug response), and (5) biological annotation using over-representation analysis (ORA) and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). The subtype pipeline includes 3 modules: (1) data preprocessing (feature selection based on variance, median absolute deviation(MAD),CoxPH model, and principal component analysis (PCA), (2) subtype identification (integration of multiple unsupervised machine learning methods (K-means clustering (K-means), hierarchical clustering, partitioning around medoids (PAM) clustering, etc.) using two popular consensus clustering methods (ConsensusClusterPlus and M3C), (3) subtype evaluation and validation.
