<p>Immune checkpoints are regulators of the immune system. These pathways are crucial for self-tolerance, which prevents the immune system from attacking cells indiscriminately. However, some cancers can protect themselves from attack by stimulating immune checkpoint targets.<span class="citation">(Pardoll 2012)</span></p>
<p>Inhibitory checkpoint molecules <span class="citation">(Nirschl and Drake 2013; Sharma and Allison 2015)</span>, including cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4), programmed death-1 (PD-1), lymphocyte activation gene-3 (LAG-3), T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin protein-3 (TIM-3),etc., are targets for cancer immunotherapy due to their potential for use in multiple types of cancers. The expression of these checkpoint molecules on T cells represents an important mechanism that the immune system uses to regulate responses to self-proteins. Recent clinical data show that these Checkpoint molecules play a critical role in objective tumor responses and improved overall survival. Therefore, CBioProfiler help users identify the correlation between the immune checkpoint molecules and the cancer biomarker they selected.</p>
<p>Parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Official gene symbol:</strong> Input one gene (biomarker candidate) with official gene symbol that you want to analyze the correlation between the gene and immune checkpoint molecules.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Correlation method:</strong> Specify the correlation methods. “pearson” means Pearson’s Correlation, “spearman” means Spearman’s Correlation.</p></li>
</ul>
