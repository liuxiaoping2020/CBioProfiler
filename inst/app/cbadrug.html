<p>Geeleher et al. recently introduced a methodology that worked by training and building statistical models from gene expression profile and drug sensitivity data in a very large panel of cancer cell lines, then applying these models to gene expression data from primary tumor biopsies <span class="citation">(Geeleher, Cox, and Huang 2014a)</span>. They also created an R package called pRRophetic <span class="citation">(Geeleher, Cox, and Huang 2014b)</span>, which extends the previously described pipeline and allows prediction of clinical drug response for many cancer drugs in an R environment. CBioProfiler takes advantage of pRRophetic to help users predict the drug sensitivity and estimate the relationship between chemotherapy drugs and the biomarker they selected.</p>
<p>Parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Select the cohort:</strong> Select the cohort that will be used for analysis.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Drug:</strong> The name of the drug for which you would like to predict sensitivity.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Tissue type:</strong> Specify if you would like to traing the models on only a subset of the CGP cell lines (based on the tissue type from which the cell lines originated). This be one any of “all” (for everything, default option), “allSolidTumors” (everything except for blood), “blood,” “breast,” “CNS,” “GI tract” ,“lung,” “skin,” “upper aerodigestive.”</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Batch correct:</strong> How should training and test data matrices be homogenized. Choices are “eb” (default) for ComBat, “qn” for quantiles normalization or “none” for no homogenization.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Group comparison method:</strong> Specify the group comparison methods. Whether to use a parametric or nonparametric test for comparisons between groups.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Perform paired-wised comparison ?:</strong> Whether to perform paired comparison?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Plot type:</strong> Select the plot type for visualization.</p></li>
</ul>
