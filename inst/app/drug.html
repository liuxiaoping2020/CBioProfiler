<p>Geeleher et al. recently introduced a methodology that worked by training and building statistical models from gene expression profile and drug sensitivity data in a very large panel of cancer cell lines, then applying these models to gene expression data from primary tumor biopsies <span class="citation">(Geeleher, Cox, and Huang 2014a)</span>. They also created an R package called pRRophetic <span class="citation">(Geeleher, Cox, and Huang 2014b)</span>, which extends the previously described pipeline and allows prediction of clinical drug response for many cancer drugs in an R environment. CBioProfiler takes advantage of pRRophetic to help users predict the drug sensitivity and estimate the relationship between chemotherapy drugs and the biomarker they selected.</p>
<p>Parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Official gene symbol:</strong> Input one gene (biomarker candidate) with official gene symbol that you want to analyze the correlation between the gene and drug response.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Correlation method:</strong> Specify the correlation methods. “pearson” means Pearson’s Correlation, “spearman” means Spearman’s Correlation.</p></li>
</ul>
