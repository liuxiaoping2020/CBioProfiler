<p>For subtype validation, CBioProfiler allows users assign the subtype on new patients. Specifically, calculate the Pearson’s or Spearman’s distances between the new patient’s representation and the mean representation of each pre-identified patient subtype, and assign the new patient to its closest subtype yielding smallest Pearson’s or Spearman’s distance.</p>
