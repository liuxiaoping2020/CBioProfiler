<p>To validate the prediction model, the users need to select and load an external validation cohort. Moreover, the users should ensure that <strong>all the selected biomarkers (features) identified by “Dimensionality reduction” should be included in the gene expression matrix of the external validation cohort</strong>.</p>
<p>The validation process uses <strong>Survival ROC curve</strong>, <strong>KM plot</strong>, <strong>Forestplot</strong>, and <strong>CoxPH table</strong> to validate the prediction model, which is similar to <strong>Construct model</strong>, thus, the corresponding parameter settings are also similar.</p>
