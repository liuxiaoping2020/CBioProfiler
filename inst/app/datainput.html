<p>In the menu, there are two window: Output window and parameter setting window. The users can input both public data and personally customized data through specifying ‘<font color="red"><strong>Data type</strong></font>.’ For public data, the users need to select one type of ‘<strong>Cancer</strong></font>’ and then specify the ‘<font color="red"><strong>Accession</strong></font>’ of the associated gene expression profile study. Finally, the data can be loaded by pressing the button ‘<font color="red"><strong>Submit dataset</strong></font>.’</p>
<p>Although we have preprocessed and curated the public data uniformly, there may still be some public data that cannot meet your needs. For example, the clinical stage of some patients are Stage I, Stage II, Stage III, and Stage IV, while What you need to analyze is the numerical Stage. In this case, you can download the data and recode the corresponding variables, and upload it as ‘<font color="red"><strong>Customized data</strong></font>’ for the next step of analysis.</p>

<h3>Public data</h3>
<p>CBioExplorer has reviewed, curated and integrated the gene expression data and corresponding clinical data of 43 common blood and solid tumors from GEO, TCGA, ICGC, TARGET, ArrayExpress, CGGA and other public databases. These public data come from 47,210 clinical samples from 268 gene expression studies.</p>
<p>To promote the use of these public data, we have develop ‘<strong>CuratedCancerPrognosisData</strong>’ that encompasses these public data. Thus, CuratedCancerPrognosis is required by CBioExplorer when running public data analysis. For more details on implementation of the two packages, please refers to <a href="https://github.com/liuxiaoping2020/CBioExplorer" class="uri">https://github.com/liuxiaoping2020/CBioExplorer</a> and <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/5728447#.YdqjDcj1dk4" class="uri">https://zenodo.org/record/5728447#.YdqjDcj1dk4</a>.</p>
<p>If you use these public data when conducting your own research, we strongly recommend that you cite these public data. For a detailed introductions regarding these public data, please refer to: <a href="https://liuxiaoping2020.github.io/CBioExplorerDatasource/" class="uri">https://liuxiaoping2020.github.io/CBioExplorerDatasource/</a>.</p>

<div id="customized-data" class="section level3">
<h3>Customized data</h3>
<p>For personally customized data, the users need to prepare their own gene expression profile data and the associated clinical data. Gene expression profile data represents a data matrix in ‘<em>csv</em>’ format where genes (with official gene symbols) in rows and sample/patient names in columns, while,the clinical data represents a data matrix in ‘<em>csv</em>’ format where the sample/patient names in rows and clinical variables in columns. The sample/patient names in the gene expression profile data matrix and clinical data matrix should be identical.</p>
