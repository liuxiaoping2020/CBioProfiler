              Background
              Gene set enrichment (GSE) analysis is a popular framework for condensing information from gene expression profiles into a pathway or signature summary. The strengths of this approach over single gene analysis include noise and dimension reduction, as well as greater biological interpretability. As molecular profiling experiments move beyond simple case-control studies, robust and flexible GSE methodologies are needed that can model pathway activity within highly heterogeneous data sets.
            
            
              Results
              To address this challenge, we introduce Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA), a GSE method that estimates variation of pathway activity over a sample population in an unsupervised manner. We demonstrate the robustness of GSVA in a comparison with current state of the art sample-wise enrichment methods. Further, we provide examples of its utility in differential pathway activity and survival analysis. Lastly, we show how GSVA works analogously with data from both microarray and RNA-seq experiments.
            
            
              Conclusions
              
                GSVA provides increased power to detect subtle pathway activity changes over a sample population in comparison to corresponding methods. While GSE methods are generally regarded as end points of a bioinformatic analysis, GSVA constitutes a starting point to build pathway-centric models of biology. Moreover, GSVA contributes to the current need of GSE methods for RNA-seq data. GSVA is an open source software package for R which forms part of the Bioconductor project and can be downloaded at

              Background
              Fibroepithelial polyps located in the ureter constitute 2–6\% of all benign tumors in the urinary system. Distinguishing these lesions from transitional cell carcinoma is essential to avoid unnecessary nephroureterectomy.
            
            
              Case presentation
              A 59-year-old asymptomatic caucasian male patient was enrolled in follow-up for Ta low-grade transitional cell bladder cancer 4 years ago in our clinic. A suspicious, solid, contrast-enhancing mass 15 × 9 mm in diameter in the anteromedial mid-section of the left kidney, which was causing minimal washout and largely located in the parenchyma, was reported as renal cell carcinoma on computed tomography during routine controls. In the excretory phase, soft-tissue densities of approximately 30 mm in length, which were located in the distal part of the left ureter at a distance of 40 mm from the ureterovesical junction, extending towards the lumen suggested a urethral carcinoma. Urothelial lesion was reported as fibroepithelial polyp after histopathological examination. Partial nephrectomy for the mass, which was reported as renal cell carcinoma in the left kidney, was performed in the first postoperative month. Histopathological examination revealed Fuhrman grade 1 papillary type renal cell carcinoma. No recurrence was observed in the first year after treatment.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Although our patient had a bladder transitional cell carcinoma and a suspicious renal cell carcinoma mass of 15 mm in the ipsilateral kidney, the patient was safeguarded from unnecessary nephroureterectomy early on by cross-sectional and endoscopic imaging of the ureter.},
