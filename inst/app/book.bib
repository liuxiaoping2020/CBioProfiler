            Genome-wide data is used to stratify patients into classes for precision medicine using clustering algorithms. A common problem in this area is selection of the number of clusters (K). The Monti consensus clustering algorithm is a widely used method which uses stability selection to estimate K. However, the method has bias towards higher values of K and yields high numbers of false positives. As a solution, we developed Monte Carlo reference-based consensus clustering (M3C), which is based on this algorithm. M3C simulates null distributions of stability scores for a range of K values thus enabling a comparison with real data to remove bias and statistically test for the presence of structure. M3C corrects the inherent bias of consensus clustering as demonstrated on simulated and real expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). For testing M3C, we developed clusterlab, a new method for simulating multivariate Gaussian clusters.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            The expression of immune checkpoint molecules on T cells represents an important mechanism that the immune system uses to regulate responses to self-proteins. Checkpoint molecules include cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4, programmed death-1, lymphocyte activation gene-3, T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin protein-3, and several others. Previous studies have identified individual roles for each of these molecules, but more recent data show that coexpression of checkpoint molecules occurs frequently on cancer-specific T cells as well as on pathogen-specific T cells in chronic infections. As the signaling pathways associated with each checkpoint molecule have not been fully elucidated, blocking multiple checkpoints with specific monoclonal antibodies results in improved outcomes in several chronic viral infections as well as in a wide array of preclinical models of cancer. Recent clinical data suggest similar effects in patients with metastatic melanoma. These findings support the concept that individual immune checkpoint molecules may function through nonoverlapping molecular mechanisms. Here, we review current data regarding immune checkpoint molecule signaling and coexpression, both in cancer and infectious disease, as well as the results of preclinical and clinical manipulations of checkpoint proteins.

This therapy has elicited durable clinical responses and, in a fraction of patients, long-term remissions where patients exhibit no clinical signs of cancer for many years. The way forward for this class of novel agents lies in our ability to understand human immune responses in the tumor microenvironment. This will provide valuable information regarding the dynamic nature of the immune response and regulation of additional pathways that will need to be targeted through combination therapies to provide survival benefit for greater numbers of patients.},

              Background
              Gene set enrichment (GSE) analysis is a popular framework for condensing information from gene expression profiles into a pathway or signature summary. The strengths of this approach over single gene analysis include noise and dimension reduction, as well as greater biological interpretability. As molecular profiling experiments move beyond simple case-control studies, robust and flexible GSE methodologies are needed that can model pathway activity within highly heterogeneous data sets.
            
            
              Results
              To address this challenge, we introduce Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA), a GSE method that estimates variation of pathway activity over a sample population in an unsupervised manner. We demonstrate the robustness of GSVA in a comparison with current state of the art sample-wise enrichment methods. Further, we provide examples of its utility in differential pathway activity and survival analysis. Lastly, we show how GSVA works analogously with data from both microarray and RNA-seq experiments.
            
            
              Conclusions
              
                GSVA provides increased power to detect subtle pathway activity changes over a sample population in comparison to corresponding methods. While GSE methods are generally regarded as end points of a bioinformatic analysis, GSVA constitutes a starting point to build pathway-centric models of biology. Moreover, GSVA contributes to the current need of GSE methods for RNA-seq data. GSVA is an open source software package for R which forms part of the Bioconductor project and can be downloaded at

	abstract = {Abstract
            
              Background
              Fibroepithelial polyps located in the ureter constitute 2–6\% of all benign tumors in the urinary system. Distinguishing these lesions from transitional cell carcinoma is essential to avoid unnecessary nephroureterectomy.
            
            
              Case presentation
              A 59-year-old asymptomatic caucasian male patient was enrolled in follow-up for Ta low-grade transitional cell bladder cancer 4 years ago in our clinic. A suspicious, solid, contrast-enhancing mass 15 × 9 mm in diameter in the anteromedial mid-section of the left kidney, which was causing minimal washout and largely located in the parenchyma, was reported as renal cell carcinoma on computed tomography during routine controls. In the excretory phase, soft-tissue densities of approximately 30 mm in length, which were located in the distal part of the left ureter at a distance of 40 mm from the ureterovesical junction, extending towards the lumen suggested a urethral carcinoma. Urothelial lesion was reported as fibroepithelial polyp after histopathological examination. Partial nephrectomy for the mass, which was reported as renal cell carcinoma in the left kidney, was performed in the first postoperative month. Histopathological examination revealed Fuhrman grade 1 papillary type renal cell carcinoma. No recurrence was observed in the first year after treatment.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Although our patient had a bladder transitional cell carcinoma and a suspicious renal cell carcinoma mass of 15 mm in the ipsilateral kidney, the patient was safeguarded from unnecessary nephroureterectomy early on by cross-sectional and endoscopic imaging of the ureter.},
