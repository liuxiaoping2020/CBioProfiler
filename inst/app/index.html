<p>Interferon-γ (IFN-γ) plays a crucial role in the regulation of antitumor immunity: mainly secreted by activated lymphocytes such as CD8 cytotoxic T-cells or CD4 T-helper cells type I (Th1), IFN-γ can enhance Th1-mediated antitumor immune response in terms of a positive feedback loop.<span class="citation">[@castro_interferon-gamma_2018]</span> IFN-γ is also known to play a protumorigenic role by transmitting antiapoptotic and proliferative signals, resulting in immune-escape of tumor cells. CBioProfiler allows users to estimate the relationship between the biomarker they selected and the IFN-γ score calculated based on ssGSEA <span class="citation">[@hanzelmann_gsva:_2013]</span>.</p>
<p>Parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Official gene symbol:</strong> Input one gene (biomarker candidate) with official gene symbol that you want to analyze the correlation between the gene and interferon-γ score.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Correlation method:</strong> Specify the correlation methods. “pearson” means Pearson’s Correlation, “spearman” means Spearman’s Correlation.</p></li>
</ul>
